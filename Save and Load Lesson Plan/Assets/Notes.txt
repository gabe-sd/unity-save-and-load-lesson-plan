__Summary__
We only need to save data that changes during a playthrough

TO save the features we've implemented so far (excluding uture features) we need:
	Grid which is composed of several tilemaps.
	For each tilemap:
		tile type (as a string) at each coordinate (as an int[] or float[])


Types of data we can save:
	Arrays of:
	string
	bool
	float
	int

-We'll need a system to save and load an individual tilemap
-We could make a file that contains a list of references to other files, each containing the data that repesents a tilemap
-That list can be an arbitrary length
-We can create tilemaps at runtime and populate them with the appropriate tiles based on the information in their save file

Next steps:
-Figure out how to save and load primitive data
-Load/save one tile on a tilemap
-Load/save an entile tilemap
-Load/save several tilemaps
